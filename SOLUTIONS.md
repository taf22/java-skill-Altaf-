## Task 2 – Basic Programming
I learned how to use conditions and variables in Java.  
The challenging part was writing the payment rules for different employee types.  
I tested my code using different hours and employee types.  
One thing I want to improve is organizing my code better using methods.

## Task 3 – Arrays and Strings
I practiced how to work with arrays and strings.  
The hard part was handling empty strings and checking values correctly.  
I tested my code using sample names and scores.  
I want to improve in validating input and writing clean logic.

## Task 4 – OOP Practice
I understood how inheritance works and the difference between static and non-static variables.  
It was a bit hard to use `super` and `@Override` correctly.  
I tested by creating objects and calling different methods.  
I want to get better at designing object-oriented programs.

## Task 5 – Problem Solving
I learned how to solve problems using patterns and simple logic.  
Formatting the output nicely was a bit tricky.  
I tested my logic with different customer types and number patterns.  
I want to improve how I display results clearly and make my code easier to read.
